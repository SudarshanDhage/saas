This folder should contain the following avatar images:
- avatar-woman-1.png
- avatar-woman-2.png
- avatar-woman-3.png
- avatar-man-1.png
- avatar-man-2.png

You can create these images using:
1. Free avatar generators like https://avataaars.com/ or https://boringavatars.com/
2. Use a placeholder service like https://ui-avatars.com/ with name initials
3. Create simple SVG avatars with different colors
4. Use free stock photos and crop them to circles

Make sure the images are square and at least 200x200px for good quality.
