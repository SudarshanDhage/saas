# 🧪 Testing Guide - New Database Structure

## ✅ Issues Fixed

1. **✅ Firebase Index Error**: Re-enabled shared projects query (index already exists)
2. **✅ TypeScript Error**: Fixed feature creation with missing fields
3. **✅ Collection Group Query**: Working properly now

## 🔍 Current Issue

The "Project not found" errors occur because you're trying to access **old project IDs** that existed in the previous flat structure. These projects don't exist in the new user-centric structure.

## 🧪 How to Test the New Implementation

### Step 1: Clean Testing
Since you have a clean database, you should start fresh:

1. **Login/Signup** to your application
2. **Avoid using old URLs** with project IDs from the previous structure

### Step 2: Create New Projects
1. Go to `/projects/create`
2. Create a new project with the AI assistant
3. This will be stored in the new structure: `users/{your-id}/projects/{new-project-id}`

### Step 3: Test Project Features
1. **View Projects**: Go to `/projects` - should show your user-specific projects
2. **Project Details**: Click on a new project to view details
3. **Sprint Plans**: Generate sprint plans (will be nested under projects)
4. **Features**: Create standalone features at `/features/create`

### Step 4: Verify Database Structure
Check your Firebase Console:

```
✅ Should see:
users/
  {your-user-id}/
    - User profile data
    projects/
      {new-project-id}/
        - Project data with userId
        sprints/
          {sprint-id}/
            - Sprint data nested under project
    features/
      {feature-id}/
        - Feature data with userId
```

## 🚨 Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work
- **User Initialization**: Automatic user profile creation on login
- **Project Creation**: New projects stored in user-specific collections
- **Sprint Generation**: Sprint plans nested under projects
- **Feature Creation**: Features stored in user-specific collections
- **Data Isolation**: Each user only sees their own data

### ❌ What Won't Work (Expected)
- **Old Project URLs**: `/projects/{old-project-id}` will show "Project not found"
- **Old Data Access**: Any references to the previous flat structure
- **Shared Projects**: Not yet tested (functionality exists but needs testing)

## 🔧 Quick Test Commands

If you want to test programmatically:

```typescript
// In browser console (after login):

// Check if user is initialized
console.log('Current user:', auth.currentUser?.uid)

// Test creating a project
import { createProject } from '@/lib/firestore-v2'
const project = await createProject({
  title: "Test Project",
  description: "Testing new database structure",
  coreFeatures: [{id: "1", name: "Test Feature", description: "Test"}],
  suggestedFeatures: []
})
console.log('Created project:', project)

// Test getting projects
import { getProjects } from '@/lib/firestore-v2'
const projects = await getProjects()
console.log('User projects:', projects)
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your implementation is working correctly if:

1. **✅ No console errors** (except for old project ID URLs)
2. **✅ User auto-initialization** works on login
3. **✅ Project creation** saves to `users/{userId}/projects/`
4. **✅ Sprint plans** are nested under projects
5. **✅ Features** are saved to `users/{userId}/features/`
6. **✅ Data isolation** - each user only sees their own data

## 🎉 Next Steps After Testing

Once you verify the new structure works:

1. **Create new projects** to replace any old ones you need
2. **Generate new sprint plans** using the new nested structure
3. **Test sharing functionality** (create a second user account to test)
4. **Add project sharing UI** if you want to use the collaboration features

## 💡 Pro Tip

Bookmark the new project URLs that are created, as they use the new ID format and will work with the new structure!

The old project IDs are expected to not work - this is correct behavior for the new secure, user-centric database structure. 🔒
